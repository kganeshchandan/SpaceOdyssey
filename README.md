Functioning of game:

    The game starts with the controls being given to player1 and player2 being immobilized.
    
    Aim of the player 1 is to reach the opposite end as quickly as possible by avoiding ufos and asteroids .
    
    If the player comes in contact with the any of the above mentioned obstacles he/she dies and score gets saved and now the other player's turn comes.
    
    If player succesfully reaches the other end of the window he/she gets promoted to next level and player controls are shifted to other player.

    The turn to play the game alternates between player 1 and player 2 untill one of them dies and then the undead player continues to play until he/she dies.

    Once both the players are dead scores will be displayed with the time penalty on the screen and after few seconds the game will restart again
    
    As the level increases the speed of asteroid increases.
    
    The longer the player playes his/her time penalty also increases.

SCORING SCHEME:

    Crossing a stationery object gives 5 score points and crossing movig objects gives 10 score points.

ENJOY THE GAME ;)
